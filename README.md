Uploading Files to the "Upload Here" folder will result in an action to produce new data for the month.
Notes about this automatic action:
    1. The Uploaded file should be deleted before uploading additional data to ensure the action happens on the right data set. 
    2. If you must re-upload the file for the month, you must delete the outputted file in the "Clean Data" folder, otherwise the data will not be updated properly. This is not necessary
    for uploads that happen in a different month as the file name takes on a current month-year format.
